Test Monitor Exercises

Commented exercises and solution suggestions proposed by me as a monitor for the Software Testing disciplines at ICMC - Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at USP (University of São Paulo). All exercises presented here were proposed by Professor Dr. Márcio Delamaro, along with theoretical references for the completion of the exercises.

Furthermore, there is an automation created for the automatic correction and validation of Java projects.
